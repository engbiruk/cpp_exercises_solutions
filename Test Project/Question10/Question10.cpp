/*
   There are three seating categories at a stadium.
    For a softball game,
            Class A seats cost $15,
            Class B seats cost $12, and
            Class C seats cost $9.
        Write a program that asks howmany tickets for each class of seats were sold, then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales. Format your dollar amount in fixed-point notation, with two decimal places of precision, and be sure the decimal point is always displayed.
